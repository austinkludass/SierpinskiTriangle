# SierpinskiTriangle
Sierpinski Triangle visualiser

This simple program visualises the creation of a Sierpinski Triangle, a mathematical fractal.
As mentioned in the program all the user needs to do is select a point somewhere in the window (preferrably inside the triangle but it will work anywhere).
Then when the user clicks play the program will continuously randomly choose point A, B or C and plot a point half way between the previous point and the chosen point.
This is repeated 30000 times which eventually displays the fractal.
